# JavaScript ES6+ Projects

This repository contains some of my work with **basic to advanced JavaScript (ES6+)** concepts. It showcases different mini-projects to learn and practice various parts of JavaScript, including:

- **DOM manipulation**
- **Fetch API integration**
- **Event handling**
- **Responsive design using HTML & CSS**
- **Error handling**
- **Dynamic data rendering**

Each project in this repository focuses on enhancing problem-solving and front-end development skills.

## Highlights:
- Clean and modular code.
- Implementation of ES6+ features like template literals, `const`/`let`, arrow functions, and more.
- Practice with asynchronous JavaScript (`fetch`, Promises, and error handling).
- Fully responsive and user-friendly interfaces.
